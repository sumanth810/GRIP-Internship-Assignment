We have a set of web services that expose functionality via REST API over HTTP. These web services are used by different types of clients namely, mobile clients, desktop clients, web clients etc.
The web services respond to the client requests based on the type of the client. How can the web services detect the type of the client? 

Develop an approach document to solve this problem. Any sample code is highly appreciated. Since HTTP Requests can carry custom headers besides the protocol headers, you may take it into consideration.
